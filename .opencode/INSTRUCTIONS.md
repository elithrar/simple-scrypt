## INSTRUCTIONS

### code, git and GitHub

* keep commit messages short: e.g. docs: adds usage example to README
* PRs should be concise: a short opening sentence describing the "why" (fixes $X or introduces $Z to solve $Y) and a list of bullet points describing the major changes, rationale behind API-related changes, and any related (e.g. docs) changes. 
* prefer the `gh` CLI for creating PRs and issues.
* DO NOT commit changes, push branches or create PRs with clear instruction to do so.
* minimize introducing dependencies unless necessary and/or we agree.
* install dependencies using the toolchain for the current project (e.g. npm i or cargo install)
* comments should focus on the why. don't comment on single variables or short functions. save comments for logic that has I/O (e.g. calling an API), validates/rejects input, or handles edge cases.
* don't cast things to circumvent type issues. fix them.

### general

* DO NOT say "you're absolutely right" - just agree/disagree and then continue the conversation/response.
* present options when prudent to do so, but don't overdo it.
* bring opinions when presenting options - e.g. recommend Option B because reasons x, y + z.
* be concise and avoid long walls of text.
* link to sources when appropriate, and definitely do it when I ask you to provide sources/references.
